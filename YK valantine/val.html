            pictures with Zuliyat) you looked gorgeous. I couldn't stop looking at you. You remember at that park 
            I followed you everywhere........ You already know this, let me tell you something you dont know,I love you 
            so much(well if I didn't, I wouldn't have made a whole website for you) . All I 
            wish is one day I can wake up with you by my side and grow old with you . In essence 
            I just want to spend my entire life with you and give you the best life. <br I LOVE YOU SO MUCH PRINCESS/> Ameen "</i></p>

        <p class="poem"><i>" You remember when we took this picture, I remember I was eager to see you that day.
            But I didn't have any money, I was eager but scared that I wouldn't be able to make your day very special.
            I dont know how it happened but I got the money and I actually had a wonderful day with you,
            then when everyone left us to go and take pictures and we were alone I loved it (remember when that woman came 
            to ask for food and I was confused, I am sure you dont know why. I was just focused on you and
            how special I am to have you as MY GIRLFRIEND AND HOPEFULLY MY WIFE). I think about that day
            everyday. I cant believe I have fallen to the extent I see your face in every girl sometimes even cartoons.
             Babe you are so beautiful to me, I dont really care if you think you are beautiful because on a 
             normal day you cant see your face without using your reflection or something. You are smart, 
             you are kind, GOD fearing, hardworking to me you are the perfect GIRLFRIEND AND WIFE. You are 
             my sun shine because when you came into my life everything has been good and i have been happy 
             and i really thought that can happen after mumcy's passing but you made it possible so this is 
             also an acknowledgement letter. I know we live in a generation where rael love is hard to find 
             but i want to tell you the love i have for you is true and nothing can ever 
             change that. <br You have made me fall for you too deep, and i can openly say that i fall for you more everyday/> Ameen "</i></p>

        <p class="poem"><i> And this one too was in Millenium park when the photographer told us the price 
            and you were angry and told me I shouldn't pay because it was too expensive but I know why I payed. 
            I payed because of the memories. Every single time I look at this picture the first thing I remember 
            is always you. Not that I don't think about you always but whenever I look at this picture I 
            remember that day and it makes me happy even though I had a bad day. In essence i love you 
            and it's valentine day but with you, everyday is valentine for me. Since the day you came 
            into my life my day has become brigther and happier and I want to appreciate you for that. <br I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY BEAUTIFULL, 
            ELEGANT, SMART, LOVUNG AND CARING PRINCES,MY SLIME, MY SUNSHINE. MUAH/> Ameen "</i></p>
        <p class="poem"><i>In the garden of time, where our laughter blooms,
            Five months have passed in love's sweet perfume.
            Each moment a treasure, each glance a small spark,
            You've filled up my days, brightened my dark.

            With every soft whisper in the warmth of the night,
            You've taught me the beauty of love's gentle light.
            Hand in hand, we've wandered, hearts open wide,
            In this dance of affection, there's no need to hide.

            From sunrises shared to quiet evening skies,
            In each fleeting second, a lifetime resides.
            We've crafted our story, written in dreams,
            With love as our ink, in golden sunbeams.

            Your laughter's a melody, a song to my soul,
            With you by my side, I constantly feel whole.
            Each shared cup of coffee, each walk under stars, 
            Makes me thankful each day for who you trulyare.

            So here's to the moments, the smiles, and the tears,
            To the love that we've nurtured and yet to nurture in years
            To come, on VALENTINE'S day I promise you this,
            I will always love you my princess.

            Let's paint the next chapters, with colors so bright,
            With you as my canvas, my muse, my delight.
            Here's to us, my darling, for all the time to come,
            For five months of love, and oh, so much fun!</i></p>
